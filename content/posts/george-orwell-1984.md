# Reading

The word [Orwellian](https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/orwellian) entered the English language after George Orwell wrote his book: Nineteen Eighty-Four.

In his fictional book the government has complete control over everything in the country - even history, science and the language. History was rewritten to make the government look better, any history that made the government look bad was deleted and went down the '[memory-hole](https://www.macmillandictionary.com/us/dictionary/american/memory-hole)'. Mathematics was changed so that '2+2=5'. Mathematics, science, fact and logic were only correct if the government said they were. Language was simplified into '[newspeak'](https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/newspeak) so that people couldn't think or communicate more than the government wanted them to.

Orwellian, 1984, memory-hole, 2+2=5 and newspeak are now regularly used in everyday conversations and also in the news as you can see from the video above. They are an important part of the English language and discussions on modern day politics can't be fully understood unless you have an understanding of Orwell and 1984.

Other common words that come from Orwell's book 1984 include: [thoughtcrime](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/thoughtcrime),  [Big Brother](https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/big-brother) and [Room 101](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_101_(game_show)). As well as being used in everyday conversations and the news they have also become the names of popular TV shows. Other terms, such as [thought police](https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/thought-police), were not invented by Orwell but [were popularized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_Police) by his book.

Orwell is often compared to Aldous Huxley. They both wrote fictional books about imaginary futures and both had an impact on the English language. Anyone learning the English language - especially if they are interested in politics - needs to read [Orwell's 1984](https://www.pearson.co.jp/en/catalog/product.php?item=404081&cat=005) and Huxley's [Brave New World](https://www.pearson.co.jp/en/catalog/product.php?item=406007).
