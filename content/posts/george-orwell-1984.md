The word [Orwellian](https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/orwellian) entered the English language after George Orwell wrote some very important books particularly ----- Orwellian generally refers to a particular book of his: Nineteen Eighty-Four, also styled as 1984, a [dystopian](https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/dystopian) vision of a [totalitarian](https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/totalitarian) future.

That legacy includes compound words and phrases that are now seen sometimes in general usage, among them [newspeak](https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/newspeak), [doublethink](https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/doublethink), thoughtcrime, doubleplusgood (‘excellent’), and doubleplusungood (‘terrible’). The familiar phrases [Big Brother](https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/big-brother) and [Room 101](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_101_(game_show)), as well as entering the common vocabulary, have also become the names of popular TV shows. Other terms, such as [thought police](https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/thought-police), were not invented by Orwell but [were popularized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_Police) by his book.

Newspeak is [of enduring interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak). A basic and artificial form of English, with distinctive patterns of grammar, it was used as [propaganda](https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/propaganda) by the novel’s [authoritarian](https://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/authoritarian) rulers, who sought to limit the thoughts and actions of the people.
