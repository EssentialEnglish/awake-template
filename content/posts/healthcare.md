# Grammar

> *Her birthday falls on a Friday next year.* (a known fact about the future)
>
> *She has her driving test next week, does she?* (a fixed arrangement)
>
> *The train arrives at 20.12.* (a timetable)
>
> *What time does their flight to Seoul leave?* (a schedule)

The reading below uses the present simple to introduce the video presentation. The present simple is often used to introduce topics that will be presented very soon in the future.

# Reading



Five centuries ago a law made by King Henry the 8th of England made it illegal to work as a doctor without the approval of a panel of experts from the Royal College of Physicians. At that time doctors didn’t work in hospitals or clinics, they worked independently as freelancers. 

As a result of the new law, there was a sudden lack of doctors because the panel of experts only approved certain approaches to medicine. In response, the King made another new law, The Herbalists Charter which allowed unapproved doctors to go back to work. These doctors later became known as Quacks. 

Nearly three centuries later the British Medical Association was created. Similar associations were then created in America and around the world. The medical associations based their medicine heavily on surgical procedures and the use of pharmaceuticals. They opposed and sometimes criminalised what they called unorthodox procedures. 

Today, many modern doctors around the world claim that the medical associations promote a myth - the myth that only their approved methods and pharmaceuticals are effective. Dr. Mercola is probably the most famous American doctor who speaks out against this myth. 

After Dr. Mercola noticed that orthodox procedures failed to treat his patients, he focused on modifying their diet and making them more physically active. Doctors like Dr. Mercola aim to help people adopt healthy diets and lifestyles. They also strive to expose corporate, government and mass media hype that diverts people from focusing on nutrition and exercise. 

Dr. Mercola and doctors like him are labeled as Quacks - the same as five hundred years ago in England.
