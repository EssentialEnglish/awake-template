# Grammar

[Relative clauses with 'who' give us more information about someone. ](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/grammar/british-grammar/who-whom?q=Who+in+relative+clauses)

We use *who* as a relative pronoun to introduce a relative clause about people:

> *The police officer who came was a friend of my father’s.*
>
> *He shared a flat with Anne Bolton, who he married, and eventually they moved to Australia.*

# Reading

The French philosopher [Henri De Saint-Simon](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henri-de-Saint-Simon) wrote,

“A scientist, my dear friends, is a man who … is ... superior to all other men.”

Saint-Simon proposed that religious leaders should be replaced by a priesthood of scientists and engineers who would turn society into a Utopia. 

The Scottish philosopher [Winwood Reade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Winwood_Reade) had similar ideas. He believed that science would change humans into superhumans. He wrote:

“... the causes of decay will be removed;[ immortality](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/immortality) will be invented. And then, ..., mankind will migrate into space, and will cross the airless Saharas which separate planet from planet, ..., men will master the forces of Nature; they will become ..., manufacturers of worlds.”

Henri De Saint-Simon is seen by many as an early [technocrat](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/technocrat) and Winwood Reade is seen by many as an early [transhumanist](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/transhumanism). Today, there are many famous people who are seen as both technocrats and transhumanists. Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are probably the most famous. Both want to fly into space and both want technology to be a part of our everyday life - [and our bodies!](https://neuralink.com/)

Technocracy and transhumanism are together known as [scientism](https://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_scientism.html). In scientism, humans replace God as the ‘immortal manufacturer of worlds’. But, it’s not all humans that will replace God, it’s only those scientists who are superior to all other men. Now that [gene editing is possible](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30971755-a-crack-in-creation) and [microchips are getting smaller](https://www.medgadget.com/2016/06/tiny-new-antenna-injectable-medical-devices.html) and more powerful we have to wonder if we want people like Musk and Bezos to have the power over how humanity is organised and society works.
