# Grammar

[The present simple can be used to refer to events in the future](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/grammar/british-grammar/future-present-simple-to-talk-about-the-future-i-work-tomorrow?q=Future%3A+present+simple+to+talk+about+the+future+%28I+work+tomorrow%29) which are certain because they are facts, or because there is a clear or fixed schedule or timetable:

> *Her birthday falls on a Friday next year.* (a known fact about the future)
>
> *She has her driving test next week, does she?* (a fixed arrangement)
>
> *The train arrives at 20.12.* (a timetable)
>
> *What time does their flight to Seoul leave?* (a schedule)

# Reading

We begin with an open question in biology—how do the shapes of creatures come about? How does a certain frog species obtain its shape and not some other shape? How do its legs and toes and claws always get their particular shape and not some other shape?

We repeat the 70 year-old idea that DNA alone somehow determines everything, though there is surprisingly little evidence. The story of DNA that we grew up with—and still teach our children—is not only wrong, it's harmful to our spirit because it gives us a false understanding of ourselves and our relationship to the universe. 

Astrophysicist and Lead Scientist of The SAFIRE Project Michael Clarage, PhD, highlights some of the evidence for the role of electricity in how plant and animal shapes come to be, and the role of electric fields in how inorganic objects obtain their shapes.

We examine three fundamental questions in the second episode of this two-part presentation. Is matter even capable of organizing itself? Where do form and shape come from? Can form exist without matter? 

Researching the origin of forms in Nature for several decades, Astrophysicist and Lead Scientist of The SAFIRE Project, Michael Clarage, PhD, has found none of our current sciences very good at describing how forms arise. Be it geology, physics, chemistry, biology, or astronomy, there is a substantial amount of hand-waving when it comes to describing how form occurs.

Dr. Clarage conveys a powerful and profound idea. When your purpose changes, your shape changes. Purpose is causal. It makes things happen and presents a more useful and meaningful cosmology for all.
