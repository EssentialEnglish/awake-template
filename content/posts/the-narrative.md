# Grammar

## [Past simple: uses](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/grammar/british-grammar/past-simple-i-worked?q=simple+past)

### Definite time in the past

We use the past simple to talk about definite time in the past (often we specify when something happened, e.g. *yesterday, three weeks ago, last year, when I was young*):

> *Did you watch that film yesterday?*
>
> *He left at the end of November.*
>
> *When they were young, they hated meat.*

### The past simple with no time reference

Sometimes there is no time expression when the past simple is used. This happens especially when we know the time:

> *Leonardo Da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa.* (From our general knowledge, we know that Leonardo Da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa a few hundred years ago.)

# Reading

Five centuries ago a law made by [King Henry the 8th of England](https://www.royal.uk/henry-viii) made it illegal to work as a doctor without the approval of a [panel of experts](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/expert-panel) from the [Royal College of Physicians](https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/about-us/who-we-are/history-royal-college-physicians). At that time doctors didn’t work in hospitals or clinics, they worked independently as freelancers. 

As a result of the new law, there was a sudden lack of doctors because the panel of experts only approved certain approaches to medicine. In response, the King made another new law, The Herbalists Charter, which allowed unapproved doctors to go back to work. These doctors later became known as [Quacks](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/quack). 

Nearly three centuries later the [British Medical Association](https://www.bma.org.uk/) was created. Similar associations were then created in America and around the world. The medical associations based their medicine heavily on surgical procedures and the use of [pharmaceuticals](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/pharmaceutical). They opposed and sometimes criminalised what they called [unorthodox](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/unorthodox) procedures. 

Today, many modern doctors around the world claim that the medical associations promote a myth - the myth that only their approved methods and pharmaceuticals are effective. [Dr. Mercola](https://www.mercola.com/forms/background.htm) is probably the most famous American doctor who speaks out against this myth. 

After Dr. Mercola noticed that orthodox procedures failed to treat his patients, he focused on modifying their diet and making them more physically active. Doctors like Dr. Mercola aim to help people adopt healthy diets and lifestyles. They also [strive](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/strive) to expose corporate, government and mass media hype that diverts people from focusing on nutrition and exercise. 

Dr. Mercola and doctors like him are labelled as Quacks - the same as five hundred years ago in England.
