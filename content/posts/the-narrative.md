# Grammar

## [Past simple or present perfect?](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/grammar/british-grammar/past-simple-or-present-perfect?q=Past+simple+or+present+perfect)

### Definite time in the past

We use the past simple to refer to definite time in the past (when we specify the time or how long) and usually with past time expressions such as *yesterday*, *two weeks ago, last year, in 1995*:

> *We met in January 1975. We went to America together in 1978.*
>
> Not: We have met in January 1975. We have gone to America together in 1978.

### Time up to now

We use the present perfect to talk about time up to now, that is, events that took place in the past but which connect with the present. The present perfect is often used with time expressions which indicate time up to now, for example *today, this year, in the last six months*:

> *I haven’t seen her since January 1995.*
>
> Not: I didn’t see her since January 1995.

[BlackRock](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/global-directory) and [Vanguard Group](https://investor.vanguard.com/corporate-portal/) are the two largest [asset management firms](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/asset-management) in the world. They are the top two owners of Time Warner, Comcast, Disney and News Corp. Companies that control more than 90% of the U.S. media. Together, they form a hidden media [monopoly](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/monopoly). They have the power to control how people view world events.

BlackRock and Vanguard are also the two largest [shareholders](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/shareholder) of GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer. They control both the media and [Big Pharma](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/big-pharma).

The response to COVID-19 has not [optimized](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/optimize?q=optimized) public health. For example, there have been [more suicides](https://collateralglobal.org/) in Japan because of lockdowns than deaths from COVID-19. The[ mainstream media](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/mainstream-media?q=+mainstream+media) has been spreading a [narrative](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/narrative) that is based on fear based and not on hope.

Big Pharma is now manufacturing drugs and [gene-therapy](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/gene-therapy) “vaccines” against COVID-19, while mainstream media have [censored](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/censor?q=censored) information about [readily available](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/readily-available) treatments that have been shown to have a [high degree of success against the infection.](https://lifefacts.lifesitenews.com/covid-19/treatments/)

BlackRock and Vanguard are not limited to owning Big Pharma and the media. BlackRock also owns shares in nearly 90% of all [S&P 500 firms](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/s-p-500) and works closely with central banks around the world. They lend money to the central banks, advise them, and develop their software.

BlackRock and Vanguard are owned by the Rothschild Investment Corp. Edmond De Rothschild Holding the Italian Orsini family, the American Bush family, the British Royal family, the du Pont family, the Morgans, Vanderbilts and Rockefellers.
